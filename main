**Q1.** Please assign values to 5 different variables each corresponding
 to a different basic data type that exist in the Python language.
 Please pay attention to [PEP 8](https://www,python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
 conventions in choosing variable names!

**Q2.** Assign variables to the individual components of your favorite gene
 (e.g promoter, 5' UTR, start_codon, exon1, intron, exon2, stop_codon 3'UTR).
 Print the entire gene by using the string concatenation operator on the standard output!
 Note: Feel free to create a fictional gene sequence by randomly filling in the components.
